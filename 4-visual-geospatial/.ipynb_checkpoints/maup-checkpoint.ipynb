    "# The Modifiable Areal Unit Problem, visually, in Python\n",

    "The [Modifiable Areal Unit Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modifiable_areal_unit_problem) (MAUP) is a well know phenomenon for any researcher interested in spatial issues. In this notebook, we'll get our hands dirty experimenting with different geographical configurations and will see, in a practical way, some of the implications of the MAUP. In doing this, we'll also tour some of the basic functionality in [`geopandas`](http://geopandas.org). \n",
    "\n",
    "To motivate this exercise, let us start from the end and show how, the exact same underlying geography, can generate radically different maps, depending on how we aggregate it:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Comparison](comparison.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we have started from a set of points located in a hypothetical geography (left panel). We can think of them as firms located over a regional economy, the distribution of a particular species of trees over space, or any other phenomenon where the main unit of observation can be described as points located somewhere in space. Now, in the central pane, we have overlayed a five by five grid and, for every polygon, which we could think of a regions, we have counted the number of units and assigned a color based on its value. In the right pane, we have done the same, using the same underlying distribution of points, but have overlaid a ten by ten grid of polygons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gist of the MAUP is that, even though the original distribution is the same, the representation we access by looking at the aggregate can vary dramatically depending on the characteristics of this aggregation. In our example, the units were points and the aggregation were simple polygons in a grid. But the same problem occurs, for example, when we look at income over individuals and aggregate the average in neighborhoods, regions or countries: if the units we use for this aggregation are not meaningful, in other words, if they don't match well the underlying process, there can be substantial distortions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have the conceptual idea clear, let's see how we have arrived to the picture above! Before anything, here are the libraries you'll need to run this notebook:"
