# Complexity in social systems - notebooks
The repository contains the Jupyter notebooks of the course "Complexity in Social Systems" for the Master's degree in Physics of Complex Systems at the University of Torino.

I have been teaching the course until the academic year 2021/2022. 

The material will not be further updated.
